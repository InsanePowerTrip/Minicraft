# Minicraft

## Introduction
Hello! This is my wanna-be Minecraft clone, Minicraft! It was developed in C.

Even though it says 50% C++, that is just libraries that I need for 3D rendering. My main source is main.c

## Download
To download it, just click [this](https://github.com/InsanePowerTrip/Minicraft/releases/latest) and download Minicraft.zip

Extract it in a folder and open "main.exe" (or main depending on your settings)
